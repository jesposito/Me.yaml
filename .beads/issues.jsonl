Research findings: 1) PocketBase has built-in pbSecurityHeaders middleware (priority -1010) that adds X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, X-Content-Type-Options to all responses. 2) Caddy (docker/Caddyfile lines 11-32) adds comprehensive headers: X-Content-Type-Options nosniff, X-Frame-Options DENY, Referrer-Policy strict-origin-when-cross-origin, Permissions-Policy, removes Server header. 3) Best practice is setting headers at reverse proxy level (Caddy) for centralized management. 4) Adding Go-level headers would create duplicates, risk conflicts with PocketBase middleware, and previous attempt broke authentication. 5) CSP intentionally omitted pending report-only rollout testing (Caddyfile comment line 31).
