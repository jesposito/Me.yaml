    "reasoning": "Credly Import Implementation Assessment:\n\n1. API Research Findings:\n- Official Credly API: Requires organization credentials (not available to individual users)\n- Public endpoint (/api/v1/users/{id}/badges): Now returns 'Unauthorized' - may have been locked down\n- Public profile pages exist (credly.com/users/{username}/badges) but require scraping HTML\n\n2. Integration Approaches:\n- Approach A: Ask user for Credly profile URL, scrape HTML (brittle, may violate ToS)\n- Approach B: Manual badge entry with Credly URL validation (simple, reliable, ToS-compliant)\n- Approach C: Wait for official Credly API access (user needs org credentials)\n\n3. Comparison to GitHub Import:\n- GitHub: Has public API with generous rate limits, well-documented\n- Credly: No public API for individuals, scraping is only option\n- Risk: HTML scraping breaks when Credly changes layout\n\n4. ToS Considerations:\n- Scraping may violate Credly Terms of Service\n- No robots.txt exception for scraping user profiles\n- Could result in IP blocking or legal issues\n\n5. Recommendation:\n- DEFER automated Credly import\n- Instead: Add manual 'Add Certification' flow with Credly URL field\n- Users can paste badge URL, we validate it exists and extract badge ID\n- Store Credly badge URL with certification for later enhancement\n- Future: If Credly opens public API, migrate to automated import\n\nConfidence: 7/10 (confident scraping is wrong approach)\nComplexity: 8/10 (HTML scraping brittle, maintenance burden)\nRisk: 7/10 (ToS violation, IP blocking, legal issues)\nValue: 4/10 (manual entry achieves 80% of value with 20% of risk)",
