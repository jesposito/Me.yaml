## 1. Vision & Principles

### 1.1 What Me.yaml Is

Me.yaml is a **self-hosted, privacy-respecting, single-owner personal profile platform**. It is best understood as:

> "A self-hosted, fully owned alternative to LinkedIn profiles — with views, versions, and sharing — built for individuals, not networks."

### 1.2 Core Philosophy

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Single-owner by design** | One person owns this instance. There are no users, no teams, no multi-tenancy. |
| **Self-hosted** | Runs on your infrastructure. One container, one port, one volume to backup. |
| **Fully owned data** | All data lives in SQLite. Export, backup, delete at will. |
| **Quiet and intentional** | No notifications, no feeds, no engagement metrics. |
| **Powerful but not loud** | Rich features that stay out of the way until needed. |
| **Not social** | No comments, likes, follows, or messaging. |
| **Privacy first** | Explicit sharing, no accidental disclosure, zero tracking. |

### 1.3 Mental Model

Think of Me.yaml as:

- **LinkedIn profile** (the content part, not the network)
- **Resume + portfolio + personal site** combined
- **With versions ("views")** for different audiences:
  - Recruiter view (focused on employment history)
  - Conference view (speaking and projects)
  - Consulting view (skills and case studies)
  - Internal view (team-specific context)
  - Personal view (friends and family)
- **With strong privacy controls** and explicit sharing
- **With zero accidental exposure** — unlisted and private content requires explicit access

This is something a thoughtful adult would host for themselves, not a SaaS product.

### 1.4 Explicit Non-Goals

Me.yaml will **never** include:

- Social features (feeds, likes, comments, follows)
- Messaging or notifications
- Multi-tenant SaaS features
- Analytics dashboards or engagement metrics
- Advertising or growth loops
- User tracking beyond basic access logging

---

## 2. Core Concepts

### 2.1 Profile

The **Profile** is the singleton identity record. There is exactly one profile per Me.yaml instance. It contains:

- **Identity**: Name, headline, location, avatar
- **Narrative**: Summary (Markdown)
- **Contact**: Email, links (GitHub, LinkedIn, etc.)
- **Visibility**: Public, unlisted, or private

The profile is the "global" identity that views inherit from and can override.

### 2.2 Content Collections

Content is organized into typed collections:

| Collection | Purpose | Key Fields |
|------------|---------|------------|
| **Experience** | Work history | Company, title, dates, description, bullets |
| **Projects** | Portfolio items | Title, summary, tech stack, links, cover image |
| **Education** | Academic background | Institution, degree, field, dates |
| **Certifications** | Professional certs | Name, issuer, dates, credential ID |
| **Skills** | Categorized skills | Name, category, proficiency level |
| **Posts** | Blog/writing | Title, content (Markdown), published date |
| **Talks** | Speaking engagements | Title, event, date, slides/video URLs |

Each content item has:
- `visibility`: public / unlisted / private
- `is_draft`: Draft items are never shown publicly
- `sort_order`: Manual ordering within collections

### 2.3 Views

**Views** are curated versions of your profile for different audiences. A view defines:

1. **What to show**: Which sections and items to include
2. **How to order**: Custom ordering of sections and items
3. **What to override**: Per-view headline, summary, CTA
4. **Who can access**: Visibility level and authentication

Views are the core differentiator of Me.yaml. They enable:
- Showing different content to recruiters vs. conference attendees
- Tailoring messaging for different contexts
- Sharing private content with specific people via tokens

### 2.4 Share Tokens

**Share tokens** enable controlled access to unlisted views:

- Generated by admin, returned exactly once
- Stored as HMAC hash (raw token never stored)
- Optional expiration date and usage limits
- Revocable at any time
- Accessed via `/s/<token>` URLs that redirect to clean canonical URLs

### 2.5 Sources

**Sources** represent external origins of content (currently GitHub repos):

- Track import origin for refresh capability
- Enable field-level locking (user customizations preserved)
- Generate **Import Proposals** for human review

### 2.6 AI Providers (Optional)

**AI Providers** are user-supplied credentials for optional enrichment:

- Support for OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, custom endpoints
- API keys encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM)
- Never auto-publish — all AI output goes through review
- Privacy modes: full README, summary only, none

```

### 3.2 Proposed Schema Extensions

**Phase 1: Profile Completeness**

Add to `profile`:
- `pronouns`: Optional, displayed with name
- `tagline`: Short one-liner (distinct from headline)
- `resume_pdf`: Auto-generated or uploaded resume

**Phase 2: Enhanced Experience/Projects**

Add to `experience`:
- `company_logo`: File upload for logos
- `employment_type`: Full-time, part-time, contract, etc.

Add to `projects`:
- `status`: Active, completed, archived, abandoned
- `year_started`, `year_ended`: Simplified date display
- `collaborators`: JSON array of names

**Phase 3: Awards & Publications**

New collections:
- `awards`: name, issuer, date, description, visibility
- `publications`: title, venue, date, url, type (paper|book|article), visibility

**Phase 4: Custom Sections**

New collection:
- `custom_sections`: name, slug, content (Markdown), sort_order, visibility

This allows users to add arbitrary content sections without schema changes.

## 4. View System Design

### 4.1 Why Views Exist

Views solve the **audience problem**: different people need to see different things.

A recruiter cares about employment history and skills. A conference organizer cares about talks and projects. A potential client cares about case studies and testimonials. Your family wants the personal touch.

Without views, you either:
1. Show everything to everyone (privacy loss)
2. Manually maintain multiple profiles (synchronization hell)
3. Use visibility toggles (loses context, awkward)

Views provide **curated lenses** onto a single source of truth.

### 4.2 What Views Control

| Aspect | Default Behavior | View Override |
|--------|------------------|---------------|
| **Sections** | All visible sections | Explicit include/exclude |
| **Items** | All visible items in section | Explicit item selection |
| **Order** | sort_order field | Custom per-view ordering |
| **Headline** | Profile headline | hero_headline override |
| **Summary** | Profile summary | hero_summary override |
| **CTA** | None | cta_text + cta_url |
| **Theme** | System default | (Future: per-view theme) |

### 4.3 Section Configuration

Views store section configuration as JSON:

```json
{
  "sections": [
    {
      "section": "experience",
      "enabled": true,
      "items": ["id1", "id2", "id3"],
      "order": 1
    },
    {
      "section": "projects",
      "enabled": true,
      "items": [],  // empty = all visible items
      "order": 2
    },
    {
      "section": "education",
      "enabled": false  // section hidden in this view
    }
  ]
}
```

**Design Decision**: Empty `items` array means "include all visible items" (filtered by visibility and draft status). This avoids manual updates when adding new content.

### 4.4 Default View Behavior

The homepage (`/`) renders the **default view**:

1. Find view where `is_default=true` AND `is_active=true` AND `visibility='public'`
2. Fallback: First public active view by creation date
3. Fallback: Legacy homepage (all public content aggregated)

**Invariant**: Only ONE view can have `is_default=true`. This is enforced by backend hooks that clear other defaults when setting a new one.

### 4.5 View Inheritance Model

Views **inherit** from the profile and **override** selectively:

```
Profile (global identity)
    ├── name: "Jane Smith"           ← Always used
    ├── headline: "Software Engineer" ← Can be overridden per view
    ├── summary: "I build things..."  ← Can be overridden per view
    └── contact_links: [...]          ← Always used

View: "Recruiter"
    ├── hero_headline: "Senior Engineer | 10+ Years Experience"  ← Override
    ├── hero_summary: "Looking for backend roles..."             ← Override
    └── cta_text: "Download Resume" → cta_url: "/resume.pdf"     ← Addition
```

**Not Overridable**: Name, avatar, contact links. These are identity, not messaging.

---

## 5. Routing & URL Philosophy

### 5.1 URL Model

Me.yaml uses **LinkedIn-style canonical URLs**:

| Route | Purpose | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `/` | Default public view | Homepage |
| `/<slug>` | Named view (canonical) | `/recruiter`, `/conference` |
| `/s/<token>` | Share link entry | Validates, sets cookie, redirects |
| `/v/<slug>` | Legacy route | 301 redirects to `/<slug>` |

### 5.2 Design Rationale

**Root-level slugs** (`/recruiter` not `/v/recruiter`):
- Cleaner URLs for sharing
- More professional appearance
- LinkedIn uses this pattern (`linkedin.com/in/username`)

**Share link redirect** (`/s/<token>` → `/<slug>`):
- Token never appears in final URL
- Token not leaked via browser history
- Token not leaked via Referer headers
- Cookie enables subsequent requests

### 5.3 Reserved Slugs

These slugs cannot be used for views (enforced at frontend and backend):

```
admin, api, s, v, _app, _, assets, static,
favicon.ico, robots.txt, sitemap.xml,
health, healthz, ready, login, logout,
auth, oauth, callback, home, index, default, profile
```

**Protection Layers**:
1. Frontend param matcher: Invalid slugs don't match `[slug=slug]` route
2. Backend hook: Returns 400 when creating views with reserved slugs

### 5.4 Slug Validation Rules

A valid view slug must:
- Not be empty
- Not be in the reserved list (case-insensitive)
- Match pattern: `^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*$`
- Not start with underscore or hyphen
- Be at most 100 characters

---

## 6. Sharing & Privacy Model

### 6.1 Visibility Levels

| Level | Access | HTTP Behavior | Use Case |
|-------|--------|---------------|----------|
| **public** | Anyone | 200 OK | General audience |
| **unlisted** | Share token required | 200 with token, 404 without | Specific people |
| **password** | Password JWT required | Password prompt, then 200 | Protected content |
| **private** | Admin only | 404 (never 401/403) | Internal/draft |

**Security Principle**: Private and unlisted content returns 404, not 401/403, to prevent discovery of existence.

### 6.2 Share Token Flow

```
1. Admin generates token for unlisted view
   POST /api/share/generate
   → Returns raw token ONCE (never stored)

2. Admin shares URL: https://example.com/s/<token>

3. User visits /s/<token>:
   - Server validates token (HMAC verification)
   - Sets httpOnly cookie (me_share_token)
   - 302 redirect to /<slug>
   - Token NOT in final URL

4. Subsequent requests to /<slug>:
   - Token read from cookie
   - Sent via X-Share-Token header
   - View data returned with sections
```

### 6.3 Token Security Properties

| Property | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| **Storage** | HMAC-SHA256 hash, not raw token |
| **Lookup** | Token prefix (12 chars) for O(1) indexed query |
| **Comparison** | Constant-time HMAC verification |
| **View-bound** | Each token tied to specific view_id |
| **Expiration** | Optional expires_at timestamp |
| **Usage limits** | Optional max_uses with use_count |
| **Revocation** | is_active flag for instant deactivation |
| **Error responses** | Uniform "invalid token" for all failure modes |

### 6.4 Password Protection Flow

```
1. User visits /protected-view (no JWT cookie):
   - Server returns { requiresPassword: true }
   - Client shows password prompt

2. User submits password:
   POST /api/password/check
   - bcrypt comparison against password_hash
   - Returns signed JWT (1-hour expiry)

3. Client stores JWT in httpOnly cookie

4. Subsequent requests include JWT:
   - Authorization: Bearer <jwt>
   - Server validates signature, expiry, view_id
   - Returns view data
```

### 6.5 JWT Claims

```json
{
  "vid": "<view-id>",
  "iss": "me.yaml",
  "aud": "view-access",
  "iat": 1234567890,
  "exp": 1234571490,
  "jti": "<random-id>"
}
```

## 7. Import & Enrichment Architecture

### 7.1 Import Pipeline

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    GitHub Import Flow                    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                          │
│  1. PREVIEW: Admin enters repo URL                       │
│     POST /api/github/preview                             │
│     → Fetch metadata, languages, topics, README          │
│     → Display to user before import                      │
│                                                          │
│  2. IMPORT: Admin confirms import                        │
│     POST /api/github/import                              │
│     → Create Source record                               │
│     → Optionally invoke AI enrichment                    │
│     → Create ImportProposal (pending)                    │
│                                                          │
│  3. REVIEW: Admin reviews each field                     │
│     /admin/review/[id]                                   │
│     → Apply / Ignore / Lock per field                    │
│     → Edit values before applying                        │
│                                                          │
│  4. APPLY: Create/update Project                         │
│     POST /api/proposals/{id}/apply                       │
│     → Apply selected fields                              │
│     → Update field_locks on project                      │
│     → Link source to project                             │
│                                                          │
│  5. REFRESH: Sync later                                  │
│     POST /api/github/refresh/{sourceId}                  │
│     → Fetch fresh data                                   │
│     → Respect field_locks                                │
│     → Create new proposal for review                     │
│                                                          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 7.2 Field Locking

When a user customizes a field (edits it beyond the imported value), they can "lock" it:

```json
{
  "field_locks": {
    "title": false,     // Can be updated on refresh
    "summary": true,    // Locked - preserved on refresh
    "description": true // Locked
  }
}
```

**Behavior**: Locked fields are skipped during refresh import. Unlocked fields appear in the new proposal for review.

### 7.3 AI Enrichment

AI enrichment is **optional** and **user-controlled**:

1. User provides their own API keys (encrypted at rest)
2. User chooses privacy mode:
   - **Full**: Send full README to AI
   - **Summary**: Send first 500 chars only
   - **None**: No AI, use raw GitHub data
3. AI output goes to proposal, not directly to project
4. User reviews and can edit every AI-generated field

**AI Guardrails** (in prompt):
- "Do not invent metrics or statistics"
- "Stay factual, avoid marketing language"
- "Use neutral, professional tone"

---

## 8. Admin UX Philosophy

### 8.1 Design Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Calm, not CMS** | No dashboard for its own sake. Information density is earned. |
| **Empty ≠ broken** | First-run shows welcoming copy, not error states or zeros. |
| **No analytics theater** | No graphs showing "0 views this week". |
| **Tending, not managing** | Editing should feel like gardening your profile, not filling forms. |

### 8.2 Empty States

When content is missing, show helpful guidance:

- **Dashboard empty**: "This is your space. You might start by adding your profile..."
- **No views**: "Views let you show different versions of your profile to different audiences."
- **No activity**: "Nothing here yet — and that's okay."
- **No AI providers**: "AI enrichment is optional. Add your own API key if you'd like AI-assisted summaries."

### 8.3 Admin Navigation

```
/admin                 Dashboard (overview)
/admin/profile         Edit core profile
/admin/experience      Manage work history
/admin/projects        Manage portfolio
/admin/education       Manage education
/admin/skills          Manage skills
/admin/views           Manage curated views
/admin/import          GitHub import wizard
/admin/review/[id]     Review import proposal
/admin/settings        AI providers, GitHub token
```

### 8.4 Visual Design

- **Consistent icons**: SVG icon set in `$lib/icons.ts`, no emojis
- **Destructive actions**: Red styling, confirmation dialogs
- **Loading states**: Skeleton loaders, not spinners everywhere
- **Dark mode**: Full support via Tailwind dark classes

---

## 9. Public UX Philosophy

### 9.1 Design Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Readability first** | Clean typography, generous whitespace |
| **Fast** | SSR, minimal JS, optimized images |
| **Accessible** | Semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard nav |
| **Printable** | Print-friendly CSS for resume printing |
| **SEO basics** | Meta tags, Open Graph, canonical URLs |

### 9.2 Public Page Structure

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           Profile Hero                  │
│  Avatar  Name  Headline  Location       │
│           Summary (Markdown)            │
│           CTA Button (if view has one)  │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           Experience Section            │
│  [Cards with company, title, dates]     │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘

│           Education Section             │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           Skills Section                │
│  [Grouped by category]                  │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              Footer                     │
│  Contact links  •  Me.yaml              │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 9.3 Password Prompt

For password-protected views:

- Minimal, clean prompt
- No indication of what content is behind it
- Single password field + submit
- Error: "Incorrect password" (not "view not found")

---

## 10. Security Invariants

### 10.1 Non-Negotiable Properties

| Invariant | Enforcement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Private content returns 404** | Never 401/403 for private/unlisted without token |
| **Tokens never stored raw** | HMAC hash only in database |
| **API keys encrypted at rest** | AES-256-GCM with derived key |
| **No public collection access** | All collections require auth for direct API |
| **Rate limiting on auth endpoints** | Strict tier (5/min) on password check |

### 10.2 Collection Access Model

**Deny-by-default**: All PocketBase collections require authentication for direct HTTP access.

```
Public data flows through custom endpoints:
  /api/view/{slug}/access  → View metadata
  /api/view/{slug}/data    → View content (with visibility checks)
  /api/homepage            → Legacy aggregated public content

These endpoints use server-side queries that bypass collection rules,
allowing them to serve public content while maintaining access control.
```

### 10.3 Key Derivation

From master `ENCRYPTION_KEY`:
- **Encryption key**: `SHA256(master + ":encryption")`
- **HMAC key**: `SHA256(master + ":hmac")`
- **JWT signing key**: `SHA256(master + ":jwt")`

### 10.4 Rate Limiting Tiers

| Tier | Rate | Burst | Endpoints |
|------|------|-------|-----------|
| Strict | 5/min | 3 | `/api/password/check` |
| Moderate | 10/min | 5 | `/api/share/validate` |
| Normal | 60/min | 10 | `/api/view/{slug}/*`, `/api/homepage` |

---

## 11. Extensibility Boundaries

### 11.1 What Can Be Extended

| Extension Point | Mechanism |
|-----------------|-----------|
| **New import sources** | Add to `sources.type` enum, create service |
| **New AI providers** | Add to `ai_providers.type` enum, extend AIService |
| **Custom sections** | Future: `custom_sections` collection |
| **Themes** | Future: Per-view CSS/theme selection |

### 11.2 What Should NOT Be Extended

| Boundary | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| **Multi-user** | Fundamental single-owner assumption |
| **Social features** | Violates core philosophy |
| **Tracking/analytics** | Privacy-first commitment |
| **SaaS features** | Self-hosted by design |

### 11.3 Plugin Architecture

Me.yaml does not currently support plugins. Future extensibility may include:
- Custom Go hooks in a designated directory
- Theme packages (CSS + layout overrides)
- Import adapters for new sources

## 12. Known Tradeoffs

### 12.1 Accepted Limitations

| Tradeoff | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| **SQLite only** | Perfect for single-user, no need for horizontal scaling |
| **Single container** | Simplest deployment, one port to expose |
| **No CDN for files** | Local file storage keeps it simple; S3 optional |
| **No JWT revocation** | Stateless tokens; 1-hour expiry is acceptable |
| **PocketBase pre-v1.0** | Widely used, pinned version, documented upgrade path |

### 12.2 Explicit Constraints

| Constraint | Implication |
|------------|-------------|
| **One profile per instance** | Family members need separate instances |
| **No scheduled sync** | GitHub refresh is manual (could add cron job) |
| **No granular permissions** | Admin is all-or-nothing |
| **No version history** | Changes overwrite; backup externally |

## 13. Feature Gaps & Future Work

### 13.1 Current Gaps

Based on codebase analysis, these features are incomplete or missing:

| Gap | Current State | Impact |
|-----|---------------|--------|
| ~~**Project detail pages**~~ | ~~Route exists, no implementation~~ | ✅ Complete: `/projects/{slug}` |
| **Post/blog pages** | Collection exists, no public UI | Cannot publish articles |
| **Talks section** | Collection exists, no UI | Cannot showcase speaking |
| **Certifications section** | Collection exists, no UI | Cannot show credentials |
| **Media library** | No implementation | Cannot manage uploaded files |
| **View editor** | Basic, no drag-drop | Limited section/item ordering |
| **Share token management UI** | Listed in views page, no full UI | Cannot manage tokens easily |
| **Scheduled GitHub sync** | Not implemented | Manual refresh only |
| **Resume PDF export** | Not implemented | Cannot generate printable resume |
| **Theme customization** | Not implemented | Single theme only |
| **Audit logging** | Minimal | Cannot review access history |

### 13.2 Proposed Priority Order

1. **Core content pages**: ~~Project details~~, posts, talks, certifications
2. **View editor improvements**: Drag-drop ordering, better section config
3. **Share token management**: Full CRUD UI with usage stats
4. **Resume export**: Generate PDF from profile/view
5. **Theme system**: Light/dark modes, color customization
6. **Scheduled sync**: Cron-based GitHub refresh
7. **Media library**: Upload management, image optimization
8. **Audit log**: Access history for share tokens
